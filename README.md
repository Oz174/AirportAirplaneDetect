# Airplane Detection with YOLOv10N 
## Overview 
Trained YoloV10N to detect airplanes on satellite image with coonfidence of 85% 

## Dataset 
Training Dataset is found on kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zidane10aa/airplanes-satellite-imagery)

## Methodology 
- Transfer Learning on pretrained Yolov10 Nano (Ultralytics)
- Reading tif large image via Pillow
- Segmented and generated predictions using SAHI (library that employs yolo detection model in prediction)

## Link to detection results will be found in the following link
